                <h2>File 1: The Infuencer</h2>
                <p>Name: Vivienne Reid<br>Age: 17<br>Birthday: March 17<br>Danger Level: <span class="high">HIGH</span><br><br>Vivienne, a high school student with a dual identity, stands as a prominent online presence with an enigmatic streaming alter ego named "FlameyV." Operating under this persona, she captivates audiences on platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok, exhibiting exceptional gaming prowess primarily in Valorant, Fortnite, and Destiny, among other titles. Boasting a follower count of 996,052, she's tantalizingly close to hitting the 1 million milestone.<br><br>A convergence of her gaming prowess and striking appearance garners her massive attention. This confluence, often dubbed as the "egirl" archetype, leverages her adeptness in various games while capitalizing on her appealing looks. This synergy fosters a loyal fanbase, fueling her rise to prominence.<br><br>Amid her high-profile virtual life, Vivienne juggles a conventional academic existence, albeit with lackluster grades—generally hovering around a C/D average. Her primary aspiration lies in transitioning to full-time streaming post-high school, emphasizing her commitment to this burgeoning career.<br><br>Unveiling a more clandestine aspect of her persona, Vivienne indulges in hacking endeavors, citing self-taught lessons from online tutorials. This dubious sideline, although not extensively explored, poses potential legal implications.<br><br>In a bid to maintain a veil of anonymity, Vivienne employs subtle tactics. During school hours, she opts for a less conspicuous appearance—sweeping her hair back and toning down makeup. Furthermore, she occasionally adopts disguises when venturing into public spaces. This practice, while partly stemming from the need to prevent recognition, equally serves as an indulgence that amplifies her sense of celebrity.<br><br>Vivienne's complex narrative entails a duality wherein her digital eminence starkly contrasts her conventional reality. As investigators, it's imperative to examine her multifaceted activities—streaming, academics, hacking, and identity concealment—to understand the motivations behind her choices and uncover any potential legal entanglements.</p>

                <h2>File 2: The Jock</h2>
                <p>Name: Adrian Rossi<br>Age: 17<br>Birthday: May 19<br>Danger Level: <span class="medium">MEDIUM</span><br><br>Adrian's life narrative is a tapestry woven with complexities and personal struggles. Born in 2002 as "Adalynn" to a Greek immigrant family, he undertook a significant transition at the age of 14, evolving into Adrian. This transformation, encompassing cosmetic adjustments and hormonal treatment, marked both an empowering milestone and a period of adversity.<br><br>Adrian's journey into self-discovery coincided with his venture into hockey, where he found a haven and a sense of masculine camaraderie. As a right winger for the Reno Hedgehogs Hockey team, he emerged as one of the most skilled players at 17 years old. Hockey acted as a conduit for his emotions, allowing him to navigate his hormonal changes and find solace in the team's acceptance.<br><br>However, beneath this facade of confidence, Adrian harbors hidden challenges.

                <h2>File 3: The Nerd</h2>
                <p>Name: Luke Silva-Vu<br>Age: 18<br>Birthday: February 10<br>Danger Level: <span class="low">LOW</span><br><br>Luke, an individual who finds himself amidst the "life is over" era (ages 18-25), radiates the essence of a fresh and unassuming nerd. Exhibiting senioritis-like behaviors from as far back as fourth grade, he epitomizes the quintessential nerd, with his personality traits modestly turned down. <br><br>While Luke carries an air of goofiness, his fascination with the existence of extraterrestrial life is a striking feature. He's fervently invested in proving the existence of aliens, even possessing specialized equipment for his "base" (a nickname for his basement sanctuary) dedicated to alien searches. However, his closest companions are his cherished pets, providing him solace in a world where human interactions often remain distant and superficial. <br><br>Although he maintains obligatory social connections at school, Luke's heart truly lies in his pet projects and cosmic aspirations. He secretly dreams of engaging with benevolent extraterrestrials in a cultural exchange, a reflection of his yearning for deeper connections that transcend terrestrial boundaries. <br><br> The label "occultist" finds a unique interpretation in Luke's life. A past experience, possibly involving an alleged UFO encounter or an anomalous event, seems to have left an indelible mark on him. Yet, he restrains himself from revealing this significant occurrence, relegating it to the realm of casual hobbies to circumvent societal skepticism and potential psychiatric assessment. This experience might be the catalyst that ignited his passion for the unexplained. <br><br>In his interactions with the opposite sex, Luke's experiences are limited. An academic standout yet possessing an air of social ineptitude, he aligns with the archetype of an intelligent yet humorously clueless individual. He's an avid follower of Vivienne's online streams and takes a genuine interest in robotics, as evidenced by his attempts to fabricate his own alien-searching equipment. <br><br>Delving into his background, Luke's heritage presents a Vietnamese-Portuguese mix, potentially set within the United States. His parents exhibit concern about his solitary inclinations, subtly suggesting he should engage more with peers. His grandparents, particularly his late grandfather, fostered his love for nerdy pursuits and the Star Wars universe, a bond that deepened after his grandfather's passing, inspiring him to explore the unknown.
                    <br><br>As investigators, it is vital to unravel the layers of Luke's identity, his fixation on extraterrestrial phenomena, his experiences, and the lasting impact of his grandfather's influence. Uncovering the roots of his obsession with aliens and his internal conflict between social isolation and the desire for connection will provide crucial insights into his motivations and choices.

She stepped in when their father was incarcerated, offering them stability and solace.<br><br>Our protagonist's resourcefulness shines through as they employ their welding skills to contribute to the household finances. This ability, passed down from their father, unexpectedly morphs into an avenue for artistic expression, as they transform scrap metals into captivating sculptures.<br><br>A dual identity emerges as they balance their role as a responsible sibling and the audacious president of the Occult Club at school.
