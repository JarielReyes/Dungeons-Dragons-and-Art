					<p>Vaxis Amory 5'8" 160lbs True Neutral Gadgeteer, Drone Jockey Pilot<br>When Vaxis was born, he appeared to be comatose, his mind wracked with visions across time and space. His parents, being lifelong criminals, stole a prototype android body for their son. Their luck ran out shortly after, as the Coalition finally caught up to them. They had given Vaxis a chance at life, but he soon found that he, too, was being hunted by the Coalition. Laying low, Vaxis survived by any means necessary. He found that he had a knack for working with machines, and constructed gadgets to protect himself. He stole any ship he could get his hands on and fled to various planets and maw stations. Occasionally, he would still get brief visions of different times or places. He wanted to make the most of his life, never forgetting all his parents did for him, and never knowing what happened to them.</p>
